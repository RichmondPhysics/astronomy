\chapter{Stellar Parallax}

This lab uses the Virtual Astronomy Laboratory software to perform
simulated observations of stellar parallax.  In fact, the writeup
is lifted (with permission, of course) straight from the manual
that came with the software.

Start up the 
{\it Virtual Astronomy Laboratory} (in the {\it Physics Applications}
section), and select option 19, {\it Stellar
Parallax}.  We'll be skipping the Preliminary Exercises and going
straight to the Stellar Parallax part.
