New lab possibilities: 

Speed of light from Jupiter's moons
other CLEA labs

Idea for Jupiter lab: measure total time for a whole number of orbits
between one opposition and the next.
Look at position of Io at the exact midpoint between those two.
Didn't work! Do eccentricities of various orbits make enough of a difference?
(Measuring synodic periods, when what's regular is sidereal.)
